    let a = 10;
    let b = a;
    console.log(a, b);
    a = 1;
    console.log(a, b);

    let name = 'steven'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'steven wang';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

  
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team2[2] = 'lux';
    team3[2] = 'lux';
    team4[2] = 'lux';
    team5[2] = 'lux';

    console.log(players, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const mayer = person;
    
    // mayer.age = 10;

    // console.log(person, mayer);
  
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const mayer2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 10, age: 10});
    
    console.log(person, mayer2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const mayer3 = {...person};

    mayer3.age = 10;

    console.log(person, mayer3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const steve = {
      name: 'steve',
      age: 10,
      social: {
        twitter: '@steve',
        facebook: 'steve kk',
      }
    }

    const steve2 = Object.assign({}, steve); // 1 level deep
    const steve3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steve)); // full copy
